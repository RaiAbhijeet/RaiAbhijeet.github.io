        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm an innovative mixed reality designer with a passion for creating immersive and interactive applications. My expertise lies in bringing augmented and virtual realities to life through cutting-edge technology and creative design.

            From an early age, I have been a committed vegetarian and an avid foodie, developing a reputation for crafting delicious veggie dishes. My journey into wellness also led me to yoga, where I continually strive to find balance and tranquility. This pursuit of harmony extends to my love for biking, as I engage with anything that has two wheels and pedals, always seeking new challenges and adventures.
            
            Traveling has always been an important part of my life, providing me with inspiration and new perspectives. I am always planning my next journey. Alongside my travels, I have a deep appreciation for documentaries and literature, always eager to immerse myself in compelling stories or uncover fascinating information.
            
            Fitness is another significant aspect of my life. Regular workouts help me maintain both physical and mental well-being. While I prioritize healthy eating, I also believe in the importance of balance and enjoy the occasional indulgence.
